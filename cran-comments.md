## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed an unused dependency (httr)
* Ensured that certain tests and examples that require internet connectivity will not be run on CRAN

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel, release, and old release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
